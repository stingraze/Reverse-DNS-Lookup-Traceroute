README for Reverse-DNS-Traceroute
by Tsubasa Kato 2015 

How to use:

$ sudo perl reverse-dns-traceroute.pl >> ip-trace.txt

This will save IP address that were reverse DNS lookup-ed to ip-outpupt.txt. Tracerouted IP address will be logged in ip-trace.txt. More work needs to be done on logging the traceroute results since it is not really organized.
